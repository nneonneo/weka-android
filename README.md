A port of Weka to Android. Currently built from r9940 (version 3.7.11). Use the same version of Weka on your desktop computer in order to share compiled models with the Android library.

Inspired by https://github.com/rjmarsan/Weka-for-Android, though this version is not based directly on that work - this version is built from much more recent code (3.7.11 instead of 3.7.3) and includes as much functionality as possible (basically everything but the GUI).
